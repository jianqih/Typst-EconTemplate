Heterogeneous workers switch employment status when the net benefit from working, a Brownian motion with drift, hits optimally chosen barriers. This implies that the duration of jobless spells for each worker has an inverse Gaussian distribution. We allow for arbitrary heterogeneity across workers and prove that the distribution of inverse Gaussian distributions is partially identified from the duration of two non-employment spells for each worker. We estimate the model using Austrian social security data and find that dynamic selection is a critical source of duration dependence.}

  abstract = {This paper compares partial and general equilibrium effects of alternative financial aid policies intended to promote college participation. We build an overlapping generations life-cycle, heterogeneous-agent, incomplete-markets model with education, labor supply, and consumption/saving decisions. Altruistic parents make inter vivos transfers to their children. Labor supply during college, government grants and loans, as well as private loans, complement parental transfers as sources of funding for college education. We find that the current financial aid system in the U.S. improves welfare, and removing it would reduce GDP by two percentage points in the long-run. Any further relaxation of government-sponsored loan limits would have no salient effects. The short-run partial equilibrium effects of expanding tuition grants (especially their need-based component) are sizeable. However, long-run general equilibrium effects are 3-4 times smaller. Every additional dollar of government grants crowds out 20-30 cents of parental transfers.},

Uninsured risk and credit constraints can distort the timing of parental investments, causing them to be delayed relative to what would occur under full-insurance. Age-dependent subsidies, taxes or transfers can all possibly correct this. Analytical results are provided, and a numerical life-cycle model provides quantitative results. Data on ability and parental investment dynamics are used to calibrate the model. A sequence of optimal policy experiments is conducted beginning with a simple reform of the tax and transfer schedule and ending with more complex parent-specific tax parameters and investment subsidies, all of which vary with child age. The final experiment generates substantial improvements in the ability distribution and a consumption equivalent welfare gain that is 2.5 times as large as simply reforming the tax schedule. About 1/4 of this incremental gain results from including childage dependent policies that alleviate distortions of parental investment timing.},

At the level of the individual, we find that person effects, especially those not related to observables like education, are a very important source of wage variation in France. Firm effects, while important, are not as important as person effects. At the level of firms, we find that enterprises that hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable. They are also more capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises that pay higher wages, controlling for person effects, are more productive and more profitable. They are also more capital intensive but are not more high-skilled labor intensive. We find that person effects explain about 90\% of inter-industry wage differentials and about 75\% of the firm-size wage effect while firm effects explain relatively little of either differential.},

We establish that this is not the case in the context of one-sector growth models such as Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans or Aiyagari models. We break down the response of the economy to a change in the environment or policy into two parts: the direct response at the given (pre-tax) prices, and the equilibrium response which plays out as prices change. Our main result demonstrates that under weak regularity conditions, regardless of the details of behavioral preferences, mistakes and constraints on decision-making, the long-run equilibrium will involve a greater capital-labor ratio if and only if the direct response (from the corresponding consumption-saving model) involves an increase in aggregate savings. One implication of this result is that, from a qualitative point of view, behavioral biases matter for long-run equilibrium if and only if they change the direction of the direct response. We show how to apply this result with the popular quasi-hyperbolic discounting preferences, self-control and temptation utilities and systematic misperceptions, clarifying the conditions under which usual comparative statics hold and those under which they are reversed.},

In standard precautionary savings models these households should not only display higher marginal propensities to consume (MPCs), but also higher future consumption growth. In contrast, we see from the PSID that such ``hand-to-mouth'' households do not display higher growth in spending. They also exhibit greater volatility of spending and adjust their spending to a greater extent through the number of categories consumed. Consistent with a role for preference heterogeneity, the panel data show that it is persistent differences across households, not current assets, that predict low consumption growth and other spending differences for the hand-to-mouth households. To identify the extent of preference heterogeneity, we consider the model of Kaplan and Violante (2014) with both liquid and illiquid assets, but allow heterogeneity in preferences. To match the data, many poor hand-to-mouth must be relatively impatient and have a high inter-temporal elasticity of substitution (IES). The model shows that preferences predominantly explain the higher MPCs for low-asset households. Preference heterogeneity notably increases the spending impact of fiscal transfers, but only if targeted, while reducing that from interest rate cuts.},

Borrowing constraints arise because borrowers face limited liability and debt repayment cannot be perfectly enforced. In the model, the dynamics of debt are closely linked with the dynamics of borrowing constraints. In fact, borrowing constraints must satisfy a dynamic consistency requirement: the value of outstanding debt restricts current access to short-term capital, but is itself determined by future access to credit. This dynamic consistency is not guaranteed in models of exogenous borrowing constraints, where the ability to raise short-term capital is limited by some prespecified function of debt. We characterize the optimal default-free contract---which minimizes borrowing constraints at all histories---and derive implications for firm growth, survival, leverage and debt maturity. The model is qualitatively consistent with stylized facts on the growth and survival of firms. Comparative statics with respect to technology and default constraints are derived.},

Since these immigrants are neither poor nor live in a society tolerant of sex discrimination/sex selection, our findings are more consistent with a preference for sons per se (and not for sons as a means to, e.g., old age support). Additionally, we uncover strong differences by religious affiliation that align with historical differences in doctrine concerning infanticide. Comparing across generations of Asian immigrants, we find fertility responds strongly to the sex composition of older children for first generation families. For the second generation, expression of son preference through the fertility channel is muted whereas sex selection seems to persist.},

We show that these interventions by the monetary authority are costly, and we derive a simple measure of these costs: they are proportional to deviations from the covered interest parity (CIP) condition and the amount of accumulated foreign reserves. Our framework can account for the recent experiences of ``safe-haven'' currencies and the sign of their observed deviations from CIP.},

This paper first establishes some basic facts about the prevalence and magnitude of marriage payments. It then discusses how such patterns vary across countries depending upon economic conditions, societal structures, institutions, and family characteristics. Marriage payments have evolved within societies over time: in some periods, payments have risen sharply; in some cases, payments have shifted from the grooms' side to the brides', and vice versa; sometimes, property rights over such payments shift between marrying partners and parental generations. The second part of this paper discusses the economic literature devoted to explaining these facts.},

The marriage squeeze argument for inflation relies on the fact that population growth leads to an excess supply of brides in the marriage market. This excess supply is resolved by some women postponing marriage, so that the average age of brides increases. In previous studies the argument is stated informally. Here, a matching model of marriage is developed to formally analyze the link between dowry payments and population growth. It is shown that a marriage squeeze cannot yield dowry inflation. In fact, when women who do not find matches at the `desirable' marrying age re-enter the marriage market as older brides, a marriage squeeze is shown to imply dowry deflation. Population change is therefore not a promising explanation for the observed increases in dowry payments.},

Second, to increase the accuracy of solutions, ECM solves for derivatives of value function jointly with value function itself. We complement ECM with other computational techniques that are suitable for high-dimensional problems, such as simulation-based grids, monomial integration rules and derivative-free solvers. The resulting value-iterative ECM method can accurately solve models with at least up to 20 state variables and can successfully compete in accuracy and speed with state-of-the-art Euler equation methods. We also use ECM to solve a challenging default risk model with a kink in value and policy functions.},

We document several new facts on product reallocation. First, every quarter around 8 percent of products are reallocated in the economy, and the entry and exit of products are prevalent among different types of firms. Second, most reallocation of products occurs within the boundaries of the firm. The entries and exits of firms only make a small contribution in the overall creation and destruction of products. Third, product reallocation is strongly pro-cyclical and declined by more than 25 percent during the Great Recession. This cyclical pattern is almost entirely explained by a decline in within firm reallocation. Motivated by these facts, we study the causes and consequences of reallocation within incumbent firms. As predicted by Schumpeterian growth theories, the rate of product reallocation strongly depends on the innovation efforts of the firms and has important implications for revenue growth, improvements in products' quality, and productivity dynamics. Our estimates suggest that the decline in product reallocation through these margins has contributed greatly to the slow growth experienced after the Great Recession.},

  abstract = {Traditional cultural practices can play an important role in development, but can also inspire condemnation. The custom of bride price, prevalent throughout sub-Saharan Africa and in parts of Asia as a payment of the groom to the family of the bride, is one example. In this paper, we show a, perhaps surprising, economic consequence of this practice. We revisit one of the beststudied historical development projects, the INPRES school construction program in Indonesia, and show that previously found small e↵ects on female enrollment mask heterogeneity by bride price tradition. Ethnic groups that traditionally engage in bride price payments at marriage increased female enrollment in response to the program. Within these ethnic groups, higher female education at marriage is associated with a higher bride price payment received, providing a greater incentive for parents to invest in girls' education and take advantage of the increased supply of schools. For those girls belonging to ethnic groups that do not practice bride price, we see no increase in education following school construction. We replicate these same findings in Zambia, where we exploit a similar school expansion program that took place in the early 2000s. While there may be significant downsides to a bride price tradition, our results suggest that any change to this cultural custom should likely be considered alongside additional policies to promote female education.},

When the sum of import and export elasticities is one, this channel is offset by a larger Keynesian multiplier, heterogeneity is irrelevant, and expenditure switching drives the output response. With plausibly lower short-term elasticities, however, the real income channel dominates, and depreciation can be contractionary for output. This weakens monetary transmission and creates a dilemma for policymakers facing capital outflows. Delayed import price pass-through weakens the real income channel, while heterogeneous consumption baskets can strengthen it.},

The mobility patterns we elicit provide evidence of segmented mobility. Over 60 percent of the population remains at the top or bottom of the wealth distribution throughout their lives. Mobility is driven by the remaining 40 percent, who move only within the middle of the distribution. Movements are tied to differential income trajectories and business activities across groups.

In this paper, we break down aggregate employment during the Recession and the recovery into changes across industries and occupations. There is a clear asymmetric pattern: The contraction is driven by sectors and the recovery by occupations. In particular, the contraction between 2008 and 2010 primarily reflects a steep decline in construction employment, partially mitigated by expansions in the food services, education, and health industries. The recovery first came from a gradual increase in low-skill occupation employment across all sectors but after 2012 from a pronounced increase in high-skill occupation employment across all sectors. This pattern of recovery is a continuation of the underlying trend of polarization across occupations, which commenced in the 1980s.},

In this article, we develop a tractable dynamic general equilibrium model in which unsecured firm credit arises from self-enforcing borrowing constraints, preventing an efficient capital allocation among heterogeneous firms. Unsecured credit rests on the value that borrowers attach to a good credit reputation which is a forward-looking variable. We argue that self-fulfilling beliefs over future credit conditions naturally generate endogenously persistent business-cycle dynamics. A dynamic complementarity between current and future borrowing limits permits uncorrelated sunspot shocks to unsecured debt to trigger persistent aggregate fluctuations in both secured and unsecured debt, factor productivity, and output. We show that these sunspot shocks are quantitatively important, accounting for around half of output volatility.},

Technology shocks account for less than 18\% of the fluctuations in output and the measured Solow residual.

This is particularly true for capital misallocation, a point we illustrate in a simple model of capital accumulation with credit constraints. We distinguish between misallocation on the intensive and the extensive margin, and show that the former should disappear asymptotically under general conditions, while the latter may persist.

Instrumenting for supplier entry and exit, we find that the elasticity of downstream firms' marginal costs to the cost share of entering and exiting suppliers is around 0.3\%. That is, marginal costs rise when suppliers are exogenously lost and they fall when suppliers are exogenously added. We show that this elasticity measures the area under the input demand curve relative to expenditures, and can be used to calibrate models with an extensive margin of inputs, such as expanding variety growth models. We develop a macroeconomic growth-accounting framework that quantifies the importance of supplier addition and separation for aggregate growth. Using firmlevel production network data and estimated microeconomic elasticities, we show that supplier churn can plausibly account for a large portion of aggregate productivity growth.},

This results in a system of two Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and two Fokker-Planck equations with a new form of coupling related to optimal transport. This MFG has a convex potential which enables us to find weak solutions by a variational approach. In the case of quadratic Hamiltonians, the problem can be reformulated in Lagrangian terms and solved numerically by an IPFP/Sinkhorn-like scheme as in [4]. We present numerical results based on this approach, these simulations exhibit different behaviours with either agglomeration or segregation dominating depending on the initial conditions and parameters.},

We build a heterogeneous agents New Keynesian model of a monetary union with two-layered regional heterogeneity. Regions are heterogeneous in (i) the local intertemporal Marginal Propensity to Consume (iMPC) and (ii) the size of the non-tradable sector. At the regional level, a Keynesian multiplier operates through the non-tradable sector. The magnitude of the regional multiplier is increasing nonlinearly in (i) and (ii). We show that, because of this non-linearity, the joint distribution over space of our two layers of regional heterogeneity shapes the nation-wide transmission of monetary policy. We provide empirical support for our theory using detailed county-level data from the US and construct a novel county-level measure of MPCs. We find that MPCs and the size of the non-tradable sector are the most important drivers of the regional heterogeneity of the employment response to monetary policy. Our sufficient statistic approach suggests that regional heterogeneity amplifies the national response to monetary policy in the context of the US economy.},

Firms choose when to enter and exit, whether to create vacancies or destroy jobs in response to shocks, and Bertrand-compete to hire and retain workers. Tractability is obtained by proving that, under a parsimonious set of assumptions, all worker and firm decisions are characterized by their joint surplus, which in turn only depends on firm productivity and size. The job ladder in marginal surplus that emerges in equilibrium determines net poaching patterns by firm characteristics that are in line with the data. As frictions vanish, the model converges to a standard competitive model of firm dynamics. The combination of firm dynamics and search frictions allows the model to: (i) quantify the misallocation cost of frictions; (ii) replicate elusive life-cycle growth profiles of superstar firms; and (iii) make sense of the failure of the job ladder around the Great Recession as a result of the collapse of firm entry.},

  abstract = {Outsourced workers experience large wage declines, yet domestic outsourcing may raise aggregate productivity. To study this equity-efficiency trade-off, we contribute a framework in which multiworker firms either hire imperfectly substitutable worker types in-house along a wage ladder, or rent labor services from contractors who hire in the same frictional labor markets. Three implications arise. First, selection into outsourcing: more productive firms are more likely to outsource to save on labor costs and higher wage premia. Second, a productivity effect: outsourcing leads firms to raise output and labor demand. Third, an outsourcing wage penalty: contractor firms pay lower wages. We find support for all three implications in French administrative data and rule out alternative explanations. Instrumenting revenue productivity using export demand shocks, we find evidence for selection into outsourcing. Instrumenting outsourcing using variation in occupational exposure, we find evidence for the productivity effect. We confirm the outsourcing wage penalty with a movers design. After structurally estimating the model and validating it against our reduced-form estimates, we find that the rise in outsourcing in France between 1997 and 2016 lowers low skill service worker earnings and welfare by 1.5\%. Outsourcing increases labor market sorting, lowers the share of rents going to workers, but raises aggregate output by 6\%. A simultaneous 5.5\% minimum wage hike stabilizes earnings and maintains employment and output gains.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an analytic representation of perturbations in heterogeneous agent economies with aggregate shocks up to any order. Treating the underlying distribution as an explicit state variable, the value function defined on an infinite-dimensional state space summarizes the entire economy and satisfies the `Master Equation' introduced in the mathematics mean field games literature. I show that analytic perturbations of the Master Equation deliver dramatic simplifications. The First-order Approximation to the Master Equation (FAME) reduces to a standard Bellman equation for the directional derivatives of the value function with respect to the distribution and aggregate shocks. The FAME has six main advantages: (i) finite dimension; (ii) closed-form mapping to steady-state objects; (iii) applicability when many distributional moments or prices enter individuals' decision such as dynamic trade, urban or job ladder settings; (iv) block-recursivity bypassing further fixed points; (v) characterization of stability and of the stochastic steady-state; (vi) fast implementation using standard numerical methods. I develop the Second-order Approximation to the Master Equation (SAME) and show that it shares these properties, making it suitable to handle nonlinearities, aggregate risk, and asset pricing. I illustrate the FAME and the SAME with two applications. First, I show that the cost of business cycles is several orders of magnitude larger in incomplete market models. Second, I show that dynamic spatial migration models display near linearity at conventional aggregate shocks.},

Aggregate dynamics and stability properties of an otherwise standard business cycle model depend nonlinearly on the degree of asset market participation. While `moderate' participation rates strengthen the role of monetary policy, low enough participation causes an inversion of results dictated by conventional wisdom. The slope of the `IS' curve changes sign, the `Taylor principle' is inverted, optimal welfare-maximizing discretionary monetary policy requires a passive policy rule and the effects and propagation of shocks are changed. However, a targeting rule implementing optimal policy under commitment delivers equilibrium determinacy regardless of the degree of asset market participation.

Countercyclical inequality yields aggregate-demand amplification and makes determinacy with Taylor rules more stringent; but solving the forward guidance puzzle requires procyclical inequality: a Catch-22. Solutions include combining inequality with a distinct risk channel, with compensating cyclicalities; I provide evidence that disposable income inequality was procyclical in the last two, Great and COVID recessions, while risk is countercyclical. Alternative policy rules also solve the Catch-22, e.g. price-level-targeting or, in the model version with liquidity, setting nominal public debt.

  abstract = {We conduct a randomized controlled trial to study the consumption response of French households to unanticipated one-time money transfers of 300 Euros. Using prepaid debit cards, we consider three implementation designs: (i) a transfer without restrictions; (ii) a transfer where any unspent value expires after three weeks; (iii) a transfer subject to a 10\% negative interest rate every week. We observe the participants' main bank accounts, such that we can compute the impact of the transfer on their overall spending. We establish five facts about MPCs in this setting. First, we find that participants in the baseline treatment group have an average marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of 23\% over one month. Second, we find that implementation design matters: the one-month MPC is substantially higher for treatment groups where any remaining balance becomes unusable after three weeks (61\%) or where remaining balances are subject to the 10\% negative interest rate every week (35\%). Third, we document that the cumulative consumption responses are concentrated in the first weeks following the transfer and are flat thereafter. Fourth, we find that there is significant MPC heterogeneity by observed household characteristics, including by liquid wealth, current income, proxies for permanent income, and gender; the MPC remains high even for agents with high liquid wealth. Fifth, we estimate the unconditional distribution of MPCs across households and find that a large fraction of households have high MPCs. These facts are difficult to reconcile with the consumption response in standard Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian models, which is long-lived and driven by households with little liquid wealth. Furthermore, we observe that households in the treatment groups with a short expiry date or a negative interest rate frequently use other means of payment while still having a sufficient balance on the prepaid card to cover their expenses, indicating that participants see money as non-fungible. Our finding that households consume more when presented with an urgent spending need lends support to theories where the salience of treatments affects economic choices. We conclude that implementation design and the targeting of transfers can greatly alter the effectiveness of stimulus policies.},

The idea relies on an assumption that linearization offers a good approximation; we share this assumption with existing linearization methods. However, unlike those methods, the approach here does not rely on direct derivation of first-order Taylor terms. It also does not use recursive methods, whereby aggregates and prices would be expressed as linear functions of the state, usually a very high-dimensional object (such as the wealth distribution). Rather, we rely merely on solving nonlinearly for a deterministic transition path: we study the equilibrium response to a single, small ``MIT shock'' carefully. We then regard this impulse response path as a numerical derivative in sequence space and hence provide our linearized solution directly using this path. The method can easily be extended to the case of many shocks and computation time rises linearly in the number of shocks. We also propose a set of checks on whether linearization is a good approximation. We assert that our method is the simplest and most transparent linearization technique among currently known methods. The key numerical tool required to implement it is value-function iteration, using a very limited set of state variables.

Households derive utility from three sources: market goods, home goods and leisure. Home production and leisure are both activities that require time and capital. Households allocate time and capital to these non-market activities and supply labor. The dynamics are driven by activity-specific TFP growth and a spread in the distribution of household-specific labor market efficiencies. When the spread is set to replicate the increase in wage inequality across education groups, the model can account for the observed average time series and cross-sectional dynamics of leisure time in the U.S. over the last five decades.},

The first contribution of our research is to document substantial variation in child sex ratios in the cross-section along a new dimension; within castes or jatis which are the building blocks of Indian society. Our second contribution is to provide an explanation for this variation, which is based on a model of assortative matching in the marriage market organized within each caste. The root cause of sex selection in the model is specific imperfections in the marriage market, which arise due to the structure of the marriage institution in India and which are shown to affect relatively wealthy households in the caste more severely. We test the predictions of the model for sorting, dowries, and sex selection across the wealth distribution within castes using unique data we have collected, covering a rural population of 1.1 million individuals in South India. Because data on multiple castes with distinct wealth distributions are available, a flexible control function approach can be implemented to estimate the causal relationship between relative wealth and sex selection. We find that the variation in sex ratios within castes in a single district is comparable to the variation across all states in the country. Estimation of the model's structural parameters allows us to quantify the impact of alternative policies that operate through the marriage market to reduce sex selection, highlighting the value of the equilibrium analysis for evaluating interventions.},

Regression discontinuity estimates indicate that unemployment benefit eligibility completely offsets potential crime increases upon job loss, but this effect vanishes completely immediately after benefit expiration.

While it has long been established that these models are very successful at replicating wealth inequality, we show that they also produce endogenous rates of return to private equity and total net worth that share important properties with their empirical counterparts. Rates of return to entrepreneurial wealth are heterogeneous, persistent, negatively correlated with net worth, and very dependent on household type. Rates of return to total net worth exhibit similar scale dependence as the data but are positively correlated with net worth.},

Consistent with the data, entrepreneurs are over-represented at the top of the income distribution and are thus disproportionately affected by an increase in the top marginal income tax rate. The top marginal tax rate that maximizes welfare is 60 percent. While average welfare gains are positive and similar across occupations along the transition, they are larger for entrepreneurs than for workers in the long run and this occupational gap in welfare gains after the tax increase widens with increasing income.},

Financial frictions lead to persistence and when combined with illiquidity to nonlinear amplification effects. Risk is endogenous and liquidity spirals cause financial instability. Increasing margins further restrict leverage and exacerbate the downturn. A demand for liquid assets and a role for money emerges. The market outcome is generically not even constrained efficient and the issuance of government debt can lead to a Pareto improvement. While financial institutions can mitigate frictions, they introduce additional fragility and through their erratic money creation harm price stability.},

We develop a tractable model with frictions in both credit and labor markets to study the aggregate and micro-level implications of a credit crunch---i.e., a sudden tightening of collateral constraints. When we simulate a credit crunch calibrated to match the observed decline in the ratio of debt to non-financial assets of the United States business sector following the 2007--2008 crisis, our model generates a sharp decline in output---explained by a drop in aggregate total factor productivity and investment---and a protracted increase in unemployment. We then explore the micro-level impact by tracking the employment dynamics for firms of different sizes and ages. The credit crunch causes a much larger reduction in the net employment growth rate of small, young establishments relative to that of large, old producers, consistent with the recent empirical findings in the literature.},

Agents increase their knowledge through binary interactions with others; their increase is modulated by the interaction and learning rate: Agents with similar knowledge learn more in encounters, while agents with very different levels benefit less from learning interactions. The optimal fraction of time spent on learning is calculated by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, resulting in a highly nonlinear forward-backward in time PDE system.},

The model fits very well a number of empirical observations, including the observed wealth distribution for entrepreneurs and workers. At the aggregate level, more restrictive borrowing constraints generate less wealth concentration and reduce average firm size, aggregate capital, and the fraction of entrepreneurs. Voluntary bequests allow some high-ability workers to establish or enlarge an entrepreneurial activity. With accidental bequests only, there would be fewer very large firms and less aggregate capital and wealth concentration.},

Models with these two features have recently become popular, but we know little about the best ways to implement them numerically. To fill this gap, we solve the stochastic neoclassical growth model with recursive preferences and stochastic volatility using four different approaches: secondand third-order perturbation, Chebyshev polynomials, and value function iteration. We document the performance of the methods in terms of computing time, implementation complexity, and accuracy. Our main finding is that perturbations are competitive in terms of accuracy with Chebyshev polynomials and value function iteration while being several orders of magnitude faster to run. Therefore, we conclude that perturbation methods are an attractive approach for computing this class of problems.},

Quantitatively, to match the observed US wealth distribution it requires significant heterogeneity in returns, consistent with our empirical findings.

The model is quantitatively consistent with several important features of the US labor market: procyclical gross and countercyclical net occupational mobility, the large volatility of unemployment and the cyclical properties of the unemployment duration distribution, among many others. Our analysis shows that occupational mobility due to workers' changing career prospects, and not occupationwide differences, interacts with aggregate conditions to drive the fluctuations of the unemployment duration distribution, and the aggregate unemployment rate.},

  abstract = {We present a joint study of the U.S. structural transformation (the decline of agriculture as the dominating sector) and regional convergence (of southern to northern average wages). We find empirically that most of the regional convergence is attributable to the structural transformation: the nationwide convergence of agricultural wages to nonagricultural wages and the faster rate of transition of the southern labor force from agricultural to nonagricultural jobs. Similar results describe the Midwest's catch-up to the Northeast (but not the relative experience of the West). To explain these observations, we construct a model in which the South (Midwest) has a comparative advantage in producing unskilled labor--intensive agricultural goods. Thus it starts with a disproportionate share of the unskilled labor force and lower per capita incomes. Over time, declining education/training costs induce an increasing proportion of the labor force to move out of the (unskilled) agricultural sector and into the (skilled) nonagricultural sector. The decline in the agricultural labor force leads to an increase in relative agricultural wages. Both effects benefit the South (Midwest) disproportionately since it has more agricultural workers. With the addition of a less than unit income elasticity of demand for farm goods and faster technological progress in farming than outside of farming, this model successfully matches the quantitative features of the U.S. structural transformation and regional convergence, as well as several other stylized facts on U.S. economic growth in the last century. The model does not rely on frictions on interregional labor and capital mobility, since in our empirical work we find this channel to be less important than the compositional effects the model emphasizes.},

Changes in a number of risk- and policy-related factors have a significant association with the evolution of CIP deviations. Key measures of FX market liquidity and intermediaries' risktaking capacity are strongly correlated with the cross-currency basis (the deviation from CIP), and the close relationship between broad U.S. dollar strength and the basis is driven mainly by a common factor depending on other safe-haven currencies' comovements. Post-crisis monetary policies also play a role, as demonstrated by the relationship between CIP deviations, central bank balance sheets, and term premia. Risk-related factors have more explanatory power than monetary policy-related factors over the entire 2010--2018 period, but they are approximately equally influential over the period's second half. Further highlighting the role of bank regulation, we offer evidence that the year-end dynamics of the three-month dollar basis depend on financial regulations targeting global systemically important financial institutions.},

  abstract = {Empirical models of production often impose input complementarity, ruling out extensive margins in the decision to ``make or buy'' inputs. I develop a model of production where labor and intermediates of similar types (``tasks'') can be complements, substitutes, or outsourced entirely. Modeling this make-or-buy decision allows me to correct for selection bias resulting from the endogenous outsourcing decision and characterize the extensive margin of factor demand. I take the model to unique data on task-level employment of labor (e.g., truck drivers) and purchases of intermediates (e.g., shipping services) and find they are gross substitutes. Elasticities of substitution range from 1.5 to 4. Labor demand is increasingly elastic over time and the labor share of costs is declining, driven by growing outsourcing and specialization. I illustrate the importance of my framework with two applications: the effect of minimum wage increases on labor demand, and the effect of import competition on productivity.},

Competitive financial intermediaries offer a menu of loan sizes and interest rates wherein each loan makes zero profits. We prove the existence of a steady-state equilibrium and characterize the circumstances under which a household defaults on its loans. We show that our model accounts for the main statistics regarding bankruptcy and unsecured credit while matching key macroeconomic aggregates, and the earnings and wealth distributions. We use this model to address the implications of a recent policy change that introduces a form of ``means testing'' for households contemplating a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. We find that this policy change yields large welfare gains.},

We also provide a new cross-fitting standard error, applying cross-fitting to estimate the asymptotic variance. In a many-moment asymptotic framework, we demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-fitting in eliminating a first-order asymptotic bias due to weighting matrix sampling errors. Additionally, we demonstrate that some economic models in the earnings dynamics literature meet certain sparsity conditions, ensuring that the proposed regularized weighting matrix behaves similarly to the oracle weighting matrix for these applications. Extensive simulation studies based on the earnings dynamics literature validate the superiority of our approach over commonly employed alternative weighting schemes.},

In this study, I develop a dynamic occupational choice model that identifies a key predictor of the early growth trajectory of young firms: the outside options of the business founders. I show that entrepreneurs with higher outside options as paid workers tend to take larger business risks, and thus exhibit a more up-or-out type of firm dynamics. I find empirical support for the model's predictions using a large founder-firm matched data set built from administrative databases of the U.S. Census Bureau. I find that controlling for past business performance, young firms operated by entrepreneurs with higher outside options exhibit (i) higher firm exit rates, (ii) more growth dispersion, and (iii) faster growth conditioning on survival. With the calibrated model, I find that deterioration in the outside options of entrepreneurs can have a sizable negative impact on aggregate output and productivity via lower risk-taking by young firms and slower growth in their life cycle. These findings indicate that the expected post-failure outcomes of entrepreneurs are an important factor that governs young firm growth as well as aggregate output and productivity.},

Second, a widening wage gap intensifies the effort competition, which induces inefficiency with higher likelihood when the returns to education effort diminish too quickly. Third, when one player's productivity improves relative to the other's, the benefitting player is encouraged to exert more effort, while his opponent tends to be discouraged to do so. The larger share of social inefficiency is carried by the less productive player. Fourth, when educational effort becomes more affordable to one player compared to the other, competition increases efficiency only if the change favors the more productive player. In the opposite case, social inefficiency increases. In both cases, the less productive player again bears the larger share of social inefficiency.},

We estimate the demand system derived from the model using household-level data from the United States and India, as well as historical aggregate-level panel data for 39 countries during the postwar period. The estimated model parsimoniously accounts for the broad patterns of sectoral reallocation observed among rich, miracle, and developing economies.

While unemployment fears can exert noticeable aggregate effects, we find their magnitude to depend importantly on the distribution of firm profits. Households' ability to borrow stabilizes the economy. Our framework has also implications for policy: in the aftermath of an adverse energy price shock, fiscal policy can help reducing the hysteresis effects on unemployment and most households gain if the central bank accommodates an employment recovery at the cost of higher inflation.},

Model parameters, including preferences, the costs of stock market participation and portfolio adjustment, are estimated to match financial decisions by different education groups. Based on the estimated model, education affects household finance mainly through increased average income. The estimation also finds evidence that higher educational attainment is associated with a lower stock market entry cost and a larger discount factor.

First, we develop a dynamic model in which households are exposed to income volatility and have no access to credit markets. If a daughter marries, her household obtains a bride price. In this framework, girls may have a higher probability of marrying early when their parents have higher marginal utility of consumption because of adverse income shocks. Second, we test the responsiveness of child marriage to income fluctuations by exploiting idiosyncratic variation in rainfall over a woman's life cycle, using a survey dataset from rural Tanzania. We find that adverse shocks during teenage years increase the probability of early marriages. Third, we use these empirical results to estimate the parameters of our model and isolate the role of the bride price custom for consumption smoothing. In counterfactual exercises, we show that child marriage bans can have lasting effects on age of marriage even after they are no longer binding and they do so at a limited utility cost to households. Cash transfers, both conditional on avoiding child marriage and unconditional, can reduce early marriages, especially when they target low-income households.},

To rationalize these patterns, we develop a job search model that incorporates gender differences in risk aversion and overoptimism about prospective offers.

Asset liquidity describes the ease of issuance and resaleability of private financial claims, which is the outcome of a costly search-and-matching process for such claims implemented by financial intermediaries. Limited liquidity of private claims creates a role for liquid assets, such as government bonds, to ease financing constraints. We show that endogenising liquidity is essential to generate positive co-movement between asset liquidity and asset prices. When the cost of intermediating funds to entrepreneurs rises, investment and output fall whereas the hedging value of liquid assets increases, driving up liquidity premia. In the United States, such intermediation cost shocks can account for at least 37\% of the variation in output, and more than 78\% of the variation in liquidity premia.},

I quantify the model for the period between 1988 and 2018 and find that technological change in the form of both higher fixed costs and more dispersed technologies, as well as a less competitive market structure can explain these trends. Viewed through the lens of the model, the primary factor underlying these secular changes is the increasing dominance of highly productive entrepreneurs who inhibit the entry of other productive agents, resulting in fewer entrepreneurs, higher markups and rising income inequality.},

I also review innovations such as the task framework developed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011). The canonical model does a surprisingly good job of predicting changes in the wage structure in the United States and other developed countries over the last half-century. Relative to the canonical model, the task framework adopts a more flexible view of technology and does a better job of fitting nonmonotonic changes in the wage structure. Yet, the task framework does not fully explain why educated workers have done so well since 1980, nor does it explain other recent facts such as flattening returns to cognitive skills and growing returns to noncognitive, ``higher-order'' skills such as teamwork. To understand these recent trends, we must move beyond a single index view of human capital toward richer, multidimensional frameworks. I conclude with a discussion of the nascent literature on the implications of multidimensional human capital for the wage structure, which raises more questions than it answers.},

The magnitude of responses due to debt maturity heterogeneity is comparable to the well-documented responses due to debt level heterogeneity. Evidence from credit ratings and borrowing responses indicates that the higher future default risk embedded in long-term debt plays an essential role. We then develop a heterogeneous rm model with investment, long-term and short-term debt, and default risk to quantitatively interpret these facts. Conditional on the level of debt, rms with more long-term debt are more likely to default on their external debt and consequently face a higher marginal cost of external nance.

FUES sequentially checks the secant lines between EGM candidate solution points and eliminates those not on the upper envelope of the value correspondence by only allowing discontinuities in the policy function at non-concave regions of the value correspondence. Unlike previous methods used to perform EGM in discretecontinuous dynamic models, FUES does not require the monotonicity of the policy functions or analytical information of the value function gradient. It is also computationally efficient, straightforward to implement, and for sufficiently large EGM grid sizes, guaranteed to recover the optimal solution.},

  abstract = {The Great Recession has witnessed not only a marked disruption in the credit markets and a sharp increase of capital underutilization, but also a severe deterioration of the matching efficiency in the labor market, as evidenced by the historically high unemployment rate and a significant outward shift of the Beveridge curve. Motivated by these facts, I develop a tractable dynamic general equilibrium model to show that financial frictions can manifest themselves as changes in the endogenous matching efficiency in the labor markets. Furthermore, I come up with sufficient statistics to capture the selection and congestion effects of financial frictions on unemployment. The analytical characterization shows that the competing effects crucially depend on interaction between credit imperfections and labor supply elasticity. I then use a calibrated version of the model to show quantitatively that the credit crunch during the financial crisis was a key driving force behind the outward shift of the Beveridge curve, which can explain up to 40\% of the rise in the unemployment rate over the business cycles.},

Monetary policy affects the conditions for the existence of a bubble, its steady-state size, and its dynamics including the initial size.

Whether monetary policy should respond to asset bubbles depends on the particular interest rate rule and exogenous shocks.},

  author = {Dong, Feng and Xu, Zhiwei},
  abstract = {Burgeoning empirical evidence suggests that credit booms may not only increase misallocation, but also sow seeds for financial crises. However, there is relative under-supply of theory accounting for these facts. To bridge the gap, we develop a unified general equilibrium banking model with heterogeneous firms to analyze the misallocation consequences of credit expansion policy both within and across sectors. The main insight is the trade-off between credit quantity and quality. On the one hand, a moderate credit expansion has a non-monotonic impact on the aggregate output. It raises credit potentially available for production at the cost of more severe productivity distortion. On the other hand, a sufficiently large credit expansion may trigger an interbank market crisis, generating discontinuous effect. The resulting economic recession is exacerbated by the firm-level productivity misallocations. By extending the static model to a dynamic environment, we show that an expansionary credit policy can generate endogenous boom-bust business cycles despite the absence of adverse shocks.},

Firstly, the distribution of firm size is uni-modal, right-skewed with a Paretian tail, which is in line with the empirical findings, in particular the Zipf Law. So is that of wage dispersion. Secondly, the incumbents prefer to preserve the pattern of labor hoarding rather than exiting the market when hit by (not too severely) negative productivity shock. Thirdly, in addition to the effect in standard search and matching theory, the labor market tightness is also found to produce additional transition mechanisms to the unemployment rate. Fourthly, the model predicts that, the larger the firm is, the longer the firm will survive at the market.},

  author = {Dong, Ding},
  abstract = {In the environment of high uncertainty, corporations may choose to diversify their business. Using data on U.S. public firms at the segment and deal levels, I empirically document that 1) Firms respond to rising cross-sectional uncertainty by stretching into new business lines and allocating assets to non-core business; 2) Diversification initiated during periods of high uncertainty is accompanied by lower post-diversification growth, equity value and credit capacity; and 3) At the aggregate level, diversification amplifies resource misallocation channel of uncertainty shocks, leading to persistent decline in aggregate productivity. I explain these facts by building a heterogeneous-firm model with endogenous diversification and external financing constraint. In the model, a cross-sectional uncertainty shock prompts a diversification wave, which redistributes cash flow and credit away from high productivity sectors, leading to inefficient reallocation of resources and decline in aggregate TFP. The misallocation effect is amplified in competitive equilibrium where negative externality of diversification choice on other firms' value is not internalized. This novel channel enables a cross-sectional uncertainty shock to generate a recession with synchronized declines in aggregate activities, in line with empirical evidence.},

A common conclusion is that agents `over-borrow' and optimal policy reduces debt positions through taxes. The reason is that agents do not internalize the effects of their choices on asset prices. However, recent empirical evidence shows that firms primarily borrow against their earnings rather than their assets. This paper studies optimal macroprudential policy with earnings-based borrowing constraints, both in closed and open economies. We reach the opposite conclusion to the previous literature. Agents `over-save' (and `under-borrow') relative to the social optimum, as they do not internalize changes in wages, which in turn affect firms' earnings. A numerical model exercise demonstrates that incorrectly rolling out a tax policy derived under the assumption of asset-based constraints in an economy where firms actually borrow based on earnings leads to a consumption equivalent welfare loss of up to 2.55\%. Optimal macroprudential policy thus critically depends on the specific form of financial constraints.},

Our model recommends higher average equity shares in the second half of life than the portfolio of the typical TDF, so that the typical TDF portfolio does not improve on investing an ageindependent 2/3 share in equity. Finally, optimal equity shares have substantial heterogeneity, particularly by wealth level, state of the business cycle, and dividend-price ratio, implying substantial gains to further customization of advice or TDFs in these dimensions.},

We craft our dynamic Roy model in a production setting where multiple tasks within occupations are assigned to workers or machines. We solve for the balanced-growth path and characterize the aggregate transitional dynamics ensuing task-biased technological innovations. In our quantitative analysis of the impact of task-biased innovations in the U.S. since 1980, we find that they account for an increased aggregate output in the order of 75\% and for a much higher dispersion in earnings. If the U.S. economy had larger barriers to mobility it would have experienced less job polarization but substantially higher inequality and lower output as occupation mobility has provided a ``escape'' for the losers from automation.},

First, we show that if financial markets are incomplete, the value of gaining access to any given level of aggregate risk sharing is greater for countries that are members of a currency union. Second, we show that even if financial markets are complete, privately optimal risk sharing is constrained inefficient. A role emerges for government intervention in risk sharing both to guarantee its existence and to influence its operation. The constrained efficient risk-sharing arrangement can be implemented by contingent transfers within a fiscal union. We find that the benefits of such a fiscal union are larger, the more asymmetric the shocks affecting the members of the currency union, the more persistent these shocks, and the less open the member economies. Finally, we compare the performance of fiscal unions and of other macroeconomic stabilization instruments available in currency unions such as capital controls, government spending, fiscal deficits, and redistribution.

Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) formalized this insight in an elegant and widely taught general equilibrium model. However, their model has not been further developed. A reason may be that their main comparative static result, that an economy-wide increase in risk aversion lowers the equilibrium wage, appeared to require the assumption that all agents had identical risk aversion index, throwing out their motivating insight and indicating that the model is intractable. In this note we prove this comparative static result on risk aversion and wages in general equilibrium, retaining agent heterogeneity in risk aversion and the endogenous division of agents into less risk averse entrepreneurs and more risk averse workers, without adding any assumptions not already in the original paper. Besides the intrinsic value of the result, we hope to increase the usefulness of the Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) model for other researchers and to facilitate improvement in its exposition for the many graduate courses in which it is taught.},

We also find almost universally negative selection on education into own-account status relative to wage workers and positive selection into employers. To quantitatively match these facts, we introduce skill-biased technological change across countries in an occupational choice model with financial frictions. Our model predicts an average of 19\% output gains in low-income countries from removing financial frictions. In contrast, an alternative model with skill-neutral technological change cannot match the high own-account employment share in low-income countries, thus overestimating the output gains by 13 percentage points.},

In this setting, changes in the monetary policy stance influence households' precautionary savings by altering the frequency of ZLB events. As a result, the model features monetary policy non-neutrality in the long run. The degree of long-run non-neutrality, i.e., by how much monetary policy shifts real rates in the ergodic distribution of the model, can be substantial when we combine low inflation targets and high levels of wealth inequality.},

We then quantify these channels during the 2021 inflation surge in Spain using detailed and high-frequency client-level data from one of the main commercial banks. The unexpected nature and temporary perception of the inflation shock in this particular period closely maps on to the assumptions behind our theoretical decomposition. Results show that the wealth and income channels are one order of magnitude larger than the consumption channel. Middle-aged individuals were largely unaffected by inflation, while older ones suffered the most.

We develop a heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian model to analyze how the distribution of taxes across households shapes spending multipliers. The model yields empirically realistic distributions in marginal propensities to consume and labor elasticities, which result in lower responsiveness to tax changes for higherincome earners. In turn, multipliers are larger when spending is financed with higher tax progressivity---that is, when the tax burden falls more heavily on higher-income earners. This result is historically material. We estimate that, on average, tax rates increased more for topincome than for bottom-income earners after a spending shock. Thus, the typical U.S. spending shock was financed with higher tax progressivity. We further exploit the historical variation in the financing of spending to estimate progressivity-dependent multipliers, which we find consistent with the model.},

The method of simulated moments is used to match the life cycle profiles of labour force participation, hours worked, and assets that are estimated from the data to those that are generated by the model. The model establishes that the tax structure of the Social Security system and pensions are key determinants of the high observed job exit rates at ages 62 and 65. Removing the tax wedge embedded in the Social Security earnings test for individuals aged 65 and older would delay job exit by almost one year. By contrast, Social Security benefit levels, health, and borrowing constraints are less important determinants of job exit at older ages. For example, reducing Social Security benefits by 20\% would cause workers to delay exit from the labour force by only three months.},

Moreover, while higher UI generosity has a mild positive effect on the employment rate, it significantly reduces the self-employment rate. We use a quantitative model of the US labor market replicating the measured micro and macro response patterns to clarify the determinants of the above dynamics. We find that alleviating (i) the asymmetry in UI coverage between paid and self-employment, and (ii) the job search requirements imposed by monitoring program applicants, play a major role in explaining the observed responsiveness to UI generosity variations of self-employment relative to paid employment.},

However, the method solves backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a forward manner, which can not be used for optimal stopping problems that in general require running BSDE backwardly. To overcome this difficulty, a recent paper [Wang, Chen, Sudjianto, Liu and Shen, arXiv:1807.06622, 2018] proposed the backward deep BSDE method to solve the optimal stopping problem. In this paper, we provide the rigorous theory for the backward deep BSDE method. Specifically, 1.

We give an upper bound of the loss function, which can be sufficiently small subject to universal approximations.

We then incorporate occupational choice under imperfect information and an endogenous learning process about innate entrepreneurial ability, which is well-disciplined by the data, into a general equilibrium heterogeneous agent life cycle model with financial frictions, bequests, and non-pecuniary motives. The model is consistent with key life cycle outcomes of self-employed business owners from U.S. administrative and survey data. We use the model to quantify the importance of information frictions and learning for selection into entrepreneurship at various stages of individuals' life cycles, demonstrating that the value of learning decreases with age, and removing information frictions benefits those with the highest entrepreneurial productivity the most. Consequently, policies aimed at reviving entrepreneurship should prioritize the young by providing them with insurance for experimentation with entrepreneurship. We show that the current U.S. progressive personal income tax system is superior to a counterfactual flat tax reform in terms of promoting entrepreneurship, as progressive taxation favors the young by imposing a lower tax burden and providing higher insurance value. This resolves uncertainty and improves occupational sorting earlier, ultimately benefiting incumbent successful entrepreneurs who emerge from the young talents.},

We develop a model with size-dependent financial frictions that is consistent with important aspects of firms' behavior in production and balance sheet data. We illustrate how the decline in the real interest rate, often attributed to the euro convergence process, leads to a significant decline in sectoral total factor productivity as capital inflows are misallocated toward firms that have higher net worth but are not necessarily more productive. We show that similar trends in dispersion and productivity losses are observed in Italy and Portugal but not in Germany, France, and Norway.},

Disagreement about systematic monetary stabilization policy is pronounced. The wealth-rich or retired tend to favor inflation targeting. The wealth-poor working class, instead, favors unemployment-centric policy. One- and two-agent alternatives can show unanimous disapproval of inflation-centric policy, instead.

For affected firms, the amount of additional debt that can be issued without violating these covenants is highly sensitive to interest rates. Combining a theoretical model with firm-level data, I find that interest coverage limits generate strong amplification from interest rates into firm borrowing and investment. Importantly, most firms that have interest coverage covenants also face a maximum on the ratio of the stock of debt to earnings. Simultaneously imposing these limits implies a novel source of state-dependence: when interest rates are high, interest coverage limits are tighter, amplifying the influence of interest rate changes and monetary policy. Conversely, in low-rate environments, debt-to-earnings covenants dominate and transmission is weakened.},

Second, we represent the value function using a neural network and train it to solve the differential equation using deep learning tools. We refer to the solution as an Economic Model Informed Neural Network (EMINN). The main advantage of this technique is that it allows us to find global solutions to high dimensional, non-linear problems. We demonstrate our algorithm by solving important models in the macroeconomics and spatial literatures (e.g. Krusell and Smith (1998), Khan and Thomas (2007), Bilal (2023)).},

  abstract = {We document how inequality in wage and salary earnings varies with GDP per capita for a large set of countries. The mean-to-median ratio and the Gini coefficient decline as we move from poorer to richer countries. Yet, this decline masks divergent patterns: while inequality at the top of the earnings distribution falls, inequality at the bottom increases. We interpret these facts within a model economy with heterogeneous workers and firms, featuring industry dynamics, search frictions, and skill accumulation of workers through on-the-job learning and training. The benchmark economy is calibrated to the UK. We then study how the earnings distribution changes with distortions that penalize high-productivity firms and frictions that reduce match formation. Distortions and frictions reduce employment, average firm size, and GDP per capita. They also affect how much firms are willing to pay workers, how well high-skill workers are matched with high-productivity firms, and how much training workers receive. The model generates the observed cross-country relation between GDP per capita and earnings inequality and a host of cross-country facts on firm size distribution, firms' training decisions, and workers' life-cycle and job tenure earnings profiles.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that high top marginal income tax rates generate large aggregate output and productivity losses. These losses arise because taxes distort the investment decisions of entrepreneurs, who constitute a large share of high-income earners. I identify two novel distortions. The first is the ``productivity investment effect''. Top income tax rates distort the productivity investment decisions not only of entrepreneurs who are already in the top income bracket but also of those who will become top earners in the future by building up their firms. The second force is the ``incorporation timing effect''. Successful entrepreneurs grow their firms and then sell their businesses to the corporate sector through incorporation. High top tax rates push these entrepreneurs to sell before their firms reach their full productivity potential. This force is driven by a feature of the tax code -- the sale of a firm is treated as capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Both effects imply that even though it targets only a small fraction of households, increasing the top marginal income tax rate generates large output costs by decreasing productivity. Since lower productivity erodes the tax base, in a calibrated model, the revenue-maximizing top income tax rate is 45\%.},

  abstract = {Adjustment to trade liberalization is associated with substantial reallocation of labor across rms within sectors. This salient feature of the data is well captured by models of international trade with heterogeneous rms. In this paper we reconsider the adjustment of rms and workers to changes in trade costs, explicitly accounting for labor market frictions and the entire adjustment path from an initial to a nal steady-state. The transitional dynamics exhibit rich patterns, varying across rms that di er in productivity levels and across workers attached to these rms. Highproductivity exporters expand employment on impact. But among lower-productivity rms some close shop on impact, other re some workers on impact and close shop at a later date, and still other rms gradually reduce their labor force and stay in the industry. In these circumstances jobs that pay similar wages ex-ante are not equally desirable ex-post, because after the trade shock highproductivity incumbents pay higher wages and provide more job security than low-productivity incumbents. After calibrating the model, we provide a quantitative assessment of the importance of various channels of adjustment. We nd that gains from trade due to a decline in the consumer price index overwhelm losses from wage cuts, job destruction, and capital losses of incumbent rms, and that these losses are increasing in the extent of labor market frictions. Additionally, we nd that downward wage rigidity generates a trade-o between the workers' displacement rates and the labor income loss. On the one hand, it prevents low-productivity rms from cutting wages in response to increased competition and, therefore, reduces the income loss. On the other hand, more rms nd it pro table to re some workers on impact, and, therefore, the temporary unemployment rates increase. The decomposition of dynamic gains from trade shows that although rms' pro t is decreasing in the minimum wage, the total gains from trade can increase due to the reduction in labor income loss.},

  abstract = {When is a wealth tax preferable to a capital income tax? When is the opposite true? More generally, can capital taxation be structured to improve productivity, incentivize innovation, and ultimately increase welfare? We study these questions theoretically in an infinite-horizon model with entrepreneurs and workers, in which entrepreneurial firms differ in their productivity and are subject to collateral constraints. The stationary equilibrium features heterogeneous returns and misallocation of capital. We show that increasing the wealth tax increases aggregate productivity. The gains result from the ``use-it-or-lose-it'' effect of wealth taxes when returns are heterogeneous, which causes a reallocation of capital from entrepreneurs with low productivity to those with high productivity. Furthermore, if the capital income tax is adjusted to balance the government's budget, aggregate capital, output, and wages also increase. We then study the welfare maximizing combination of wealth and capital income taxes and show that the optimal mix shifts towards a higher wealth tax and a lower capital income tax as the capital intensity of production increases. For a range of plausible parameter values, the optimal wealth tax is positive, whereas the capital income tax can be positive or negative (a subsidy). We then endogenize the entrepreneurial productivity distribution by introducing either ex ante innovation or entrepreneurial effort in production and show that this strengthens our results: by allowing entrepreneurs to keep more of the upside relative to a capital income tax, a wealth tax incentivizes more innovation and entrepreneurial effort, leading to larger increases in productivity, output, and welfare.},

  abstract = {This article reviews macroeconomic models with heterogeneous households. A key question for the relevance of these models concerns the degree to which markets are complete. This is because the existence of complete markets imposes restrictions on (i) how much heterogeneity matters for aggregate phenomena and (ii) the types of cross-sectional distributions that can be obtained. The degree of market incompleteness, in turn, depends on two factors: (i) the richness of insurance opportunities provided by the economic environment and (ii) the nature and magnitude of idiosyncratic risks to be insured. First, I review a broad collection of empirical evidence--from econometric tests of "full insurance," to quantitative and empirical analyses of the permanent income ("self-insurance") model that examine how it fits the facts about life cycle allocations, to studies that try to directly measure where economies place between these two benchmarks ("partial insurance"). The empirical evidence I survey reveals significant uncertainty in the profession regarding the magnitudes of idiosyncratic risks as well as whether or not these risks have increased since the 1970s. An important difficulty stems from the fact that inequality often arises from a mixture of idiosyncratic risk and fixed (or predictable) heterogeneity, making the two challenging to disentangle. I also discuss applications of incomplete markets models to trends in wealth, consumption, and earnings inequality both over the life cycle and over time, where this challenge is evident. Third, I discuss "approximate" aggregation--the finding that some incomplete markets models generate aggregate implications very similar to representative-agent models. What approximate aggregation does and does not imply is illustrated through several examples. Finally, I discuss some computational issues relevant for solving and calibrating such models and I provide a simple yet fully parallelizable global optimization algorithm that can be used to calibrate heterogeneous agent models.},

Income pooling within the family and redistribution by the government have enormous impacts on the dynamics of household-level inequality, with the role of the family diminishing and that of the government growing over time. In particular, largely due to generous government transfers, the COVID recession has been the first downturn in fifty years in which inequality in disposable income and consumption actually declined.},

We apply our framework to data from Germany: twenty-five years after the reunification, real wages in the East are still 26 percent lower than those in the West. We find that 60 percent of the wage gap is due to labor being paid a higher wage per efficiency unit in West Germany, and quantify three distinct barriers that prevent East Germans from migrating west to obtain a higher wage: migration costs, workers' preferences to live in their home region, and more frequent job opportunities received from home. Interpreting the data as a frictional labor market, we estimate that these spatial barriers to mobility are small, which implies that the spatial misallocation of workers between East and West Germany has at most moderate aggregate effects.},

Using linked employer-employee data for Brazil, we show that much of overall wage inequality arises within sector-occupations and for workers with similar observable characteristics; this within component is driven by wage dispersion between firms; and wage dispersion between firms is related to firm employment size and trade participation. We then extend the heterogenous-firm model of trade and inequality from Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010) and estimate it with Brazilian data. We show that the estimated model provides a close approximation to the observed distribution of wages and employment. We use the estimated model to undertake counterfactuals, in which we find sizable effects of trade on wage inequality.},

We argue that this multi-sector model serves as a natural benchmark to study structural transformation and that it is able to account for many salient features of structural transformation. We also argue that this multi-sector model delivers new and sharper insights for understanding economic development, regional income convergence, aggregate productivity trends, hours worked, business cycles, and wage inequality. We conclude by suggesting several directions for future research on structural transformation.},

To study the business cycle implications of turbulence shocks, we use Compustat data to construct a measure of turbulence based on the (inverse of) Spearman correlations of firms' productivity rankings between adjacent years. We document evidence that turbulence rises in recessions, reallocating labor and capital from high- to low-productivity firms and reducing aggregate TFP and the stock market value of firms. A real business cycle model with heterogeneous firms and financial frictions can generate the observed macroeconomic and reallocation effects of turbulence. In the model, increased turbulence makes high-productivity firms less likely to remain productive, reducing their expected equity values and tightening their borrowing constraints relative to low-productivity firms. This leads to a reallocation that reduces aggregate TFP. Unlike uncertainty, turbulence changes both the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the firm productivity distribution, enabling a turbulence shock to generate a recession with synchronized declines in aggregate activities.},

TFP gaps are characterized as the integral of a strictly concave function with respect to an employment-weighted measure of distortions. Size related distortions are shown to correspond to a mean preserving spread of this measure, explaining the stronger effects on TFP found in the literature. In general, the effect of correlation between distortions and productivity is shown to be ambiguous; conditions are given to determine its sign. An empirical lower bound on distortions based on size distribution of firms is derived and analyzed, revealing that substantial rank reversals in firm size are necessary for distortions to explain large TFP gaps. The effect of curvature on the impact and measurement of distortions is also considered.},

This contract involves a replacement ratio that decreases throughout the unemployment spell and a wage tax after reemployment that, under some mild regularity conditions, increases with the lenght of the unemployment spell. Some numerical results are presented that suggest that the gains from switching to this optimal unemployment insurance scheme could be quite large. The performance of this optimal contract is also compared to alternative liquidity provision mechanisms.},

Changes in population growth provide a unified quantitative explanation. A decrease in population growth lowers firm entry rates, shifting the firm-age distribution toward older firms. Firm aging accounts for (i) the concentration of employment in large firms, (ii) and trends in average firm size and exit rates, key determinants of firm entry rates. Feedback effects from firm demographics generate two-thirds of the effect. Prior to the decrease, entry rates rose steadily reflecting the earlier baby boom. The glut of firms due to the baby boom lead to rich transitional dynamics within the feedback effects, accounting for more than half the total change. Baby boom induced changes in the firm-age distribution provide a driving force for the post-WWII rise and fall in the aggregate labor share. Ignoring changes in population growth attributes all the long run decline in entry rates to a decrease in firm exit rates, which in reality have been only one-third as large.},

Segmenting businesses into industries with high-- and low--starting capital requirements, we find no evidence that wealth matters more for businesses requiring higher initial capital. When using inheritances as an instrument for wealth, we find that both past and future inheritances predict current business entry, showing that inheritances capture more than simply liquidity. We further exploit the regional variation in house prices and find that households that lived in regions in which housing prices appreciated strongly were no more likely to start a business than households in other regions.}

  abstract = {The modeling and control of complex physical systems are essential in real-world problems. We propose a novel framework that is generally applicable to solving PDE-constrained optimal control problems by introducing surrogate models for PDE solution operators with special regularizers. The procedure of the proposed framework is divided into two phases: solution operator learning for PDE constraints (Phase 1) and searching for optimal control (Phase 2). Once the surrogate model is trained in Phase 1, the optimal control can be inferred in Phase 2 without intensive computations. Our framework can be applied to both data-driven and data-free cases. We demonstrate the successful application of our method to various optimal control problems for different control variables with diverse PDE constraints from the Poisson equation to Burgers' equation.},

  abstract = {We survey literature on ambiguity with an emphasis on recent applications in macroeconomics and finance. Like risk, ambiguity leads to cautious behavior and uncertainty premia in asset markets. Unlike risk, ambiguity can generate first order welfare losses. As a result, precautionary behavior and ambiguity premia obtain even when agents have linear utility and are reflected in linear approximations to model dynamics. Quantitative work exploits this insight to estimate models that jointly match the dynamics of asset prices and macro aggregates. In micro data, inertia and inaction due to ambiguity help understand patterns such as non-participation in asset markets, price rigidities and simple contracts. Learning under ambiguity generates asymmetric responses to news that help connect higher moments in micro and macro data. Survey evidence is increasingly used to provide direct evidence on ambiguity averse behavior, as well as to discipline quantitative models.},

We show how these problems are ameliorated in the presence of additive choice-specific independent and identically distributed extreme value taste shocks that are typically interpreted as ``unobserved state variables'' in structural econometric applications, or serve as ``random noise'' to smooth out kinks in the value functions in numerical applications. We present Monte Carlo experiments that demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the DC-EGM algorithm and the associated maximum likelihood estimator for structural estimation of a life-cycle model of consumption with discrete retirement decisions.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a novel characterization of time-varying heterogeneous earnings risk through a Markov process with heterogeneous transition probabilities. The resulting earnings process allows for a richer notion of earnings risk heterogeneity than previously studied by the literature. Assumptions are derived under which a combination of savings and earnings data can be used to identify the earnings process parameters. Alternatively, a narrow interpretation of earnings risk can be adopted, limiting risk heterogeneity to heterogeneous variances of earnings shocks, such that the earnings process is identifiable from earnings data only. This gives rise to two identification strategies. Applying both strategies to the Survey of Income and Program Participation dataset shows that individuals face considerable inequality of earnings risk. High-risk states are found to be temporary, while low-risk states are persistent. Comparing both strategies shows that only allowing for variance heterogeneity is too restrictive, and a rich notion of risk is required to capture the joint dynamics of individuals' savings and earnings.},

Multi-step estimators, while less efficient in the absence of misspecification, can isolate subsets of parameters from misspecification in other parts of the model, and efficiency losses are therefore directly rewarded by robustness gains. I illustrate this in the workhorse heterogeneous household model of Aiyagari (1994) by establishing its block structure and showing how the firm-side parameters can be isolated from misspecification in the earnings process of the households. Similarly, in the workhorse heterogeneous firm model of Khan and Thomas (2008), I show that a one-step estimation procedure can overestimate the adjustment cost of capital by as much as 90 percent when omitting investment shocks from the aggregate shock process, while its two-step estimator is unaffected.},

In a model with exogenous income risks (e.g. Mirrlees, 1971), the optimal contract considers the tradeoff between insurance against income risks and the incentive to work. In the presence of search frictions, income risks become endogenous as the agent sets the reservation wage in the labor market. Providing more insurance allows the agent to take more search risks by raising the reservation wage, which enables the agent to be matched with higher-paid jobs. I show that the existence of search frictions implies that the optimal contract should provide more insurance to the agent (1) by subsidizing unemployment and (2) by flattening wage income distribution during employment across different jobs. The optimal contract derived in this note theoretically justify why the income-based repayment plan of student debt repayment evaluated by Ji (2019) can significantly outperform the fixed repayment plan.},

This paper develops a model where capital innovations occur on two margins: (1) vertically, where a capital input becomes more productive at a given task; and (2) horizontally, where a capital input replaces labor at a given task. These two forms of technological advance engage in a macroeconomic ``tug of war'' when capital and labor have less than a unitary elasticity of substitution, and the resulting framework can meet numerous macroeconomic regularities. First, it can produce a balanced growth path and satisfy the Uzawa Growth Theorem---even though all technological progress occurs in capital inputs. Second, it can produce intuitive macroeconomic dynamics, adding perspectives on the apparent productivity slowdown and declining labor share of income. Third, it can produce rich industry dynamics and inform structural change, including declining GDP shares of agriculture and manufacturing, sectoral bottlenecks, the role of general purpose technologies, and the limited macroeconomic impacts of computing. Overall, this tractable framework can help resolve puzzling tensions between micro-level observations of technological advance and macroeconomic features of economic growth.},

U.S. growth for the past 150 years has been surprisingly stable at 2\% per year. Growth theory reveals that in the long run, growth in living standards is determined by growth in the worldwide number of people searching for ideas. At the same time, a growth accounting exercise for the United States since the 1950s suggests that many other factors have temporarily contributed to growth, including rising educational attainment and a rising investment rate in ideas. But these forces are inherently temporary, implying that growth rates could slow in the future. This prediction is reinforced by declining population growth throughout the world. In contrast, other forces could potentially sustain or even increase growth. The emergence of countries such as China and India provides large numbers of people who could search for ideas. Improvements in the allocation of talent --- for example, the rise of women inventors --- and increased automation through artificial intelligence are other potential tailwinds.},

We develop a general equilibrium model with occupation-specific human capital and heterogeneous experience levels within occupations. We find that the model, calibrated to match the level of occupational mobility in the 1970's, accounts quite well for the level of (within-group) wage inequality in that period. Next, we find that the model, calibrated to match the increase in occupational mobility, accounts for over 90\% of the increase in wage inequality between the 1970's and the 1990's.

This literature opens the door to the analysis of distributional issues, economic fluctuations, and stabilization policies---all within the same framework. In response to the limitations of the representative agent approach to economic fluctuations, a new framework has emerged that combines key features of heterogeneous agents (HA) and New Keynesian (NK) economies. These HANK models  offer a much more accurate representation of household consumption behavior and can generate realistic distributions of income, wealth, and, albeit to a lesser degree, household balance sheets. At the same time, they can accommodate many sources of macroeconomic fluctuations, including those driven by aggregate demand. In sum, they provide a rich theoretical framework for quantitative analysis of the interaction between cross-sectional distributions and aggregate dynamics. In this article, we outline a state-of-the-art version of  HANK together with its representative agent counterpart, and convey two broad messages about the role of household heterogeneity for the response of the macroeconomy to aggregate shocks: 1) the similarity between the Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) and HANK frameworks depends crucially on the shock being analyzed; and 2) certain important macroeconomic questions concerning economic fluctuations can only be addressed within heterogeneous agent models.},

The model yields empirically realistic distributions of wealth and marginal propensities to consume because of two features: uninsurable income shocks and multiple assets with different degrees of liquidity and different returns. In this environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected cut in interest rates, which operate through a general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) economies, where the substitution channel drives virtually all of the transmission from interest rates to consumption. Failure of Ricardian equivalence implies that, in HANK models, the fiscal reaction to the monetary expansion is a key determinant of the overall size of the macroeconomic response.},

Unlike in representative agent economies, steady-state equilibria exist when the government runs persistent deficits, provided that the level of deficits is not too large. In these equilibria, the real interest rate is below the growth rate of the economy. We quantify the maximum sustainable deficit for the US and show that it is lower under more redistributive tax and transfer systems. With constant primary deficits, there exist two steady-states, and the price level and inflation are not uniquely determined. We describe alternative policy settings that deliver uniqueness. We conduct quantitative experiments to illustrate how redistribution and precautionary saving amplify price level increases in response to fiscal helicopter drops, deficit expansions, and loose monetary policy. We show that rising primary deficits can account for a decline in the long-run real interest rate, leading to higher inflation for any given monetary policy. Our work highlights the role of household heterogeneity and market incompleteness in determining inflation.},

When a firm increases its workforce, it raises demand and weakens competition facing other firms, as employed workers spend more and have less time to search for low prices than unemployed workers. These effects induce other firms to hire more labor in order to scale up their presence in the product market. The feedback between employment and product market conditions generates multiple equilibria---and the possibility of self-fulfilling fluctuations---if differences in shopping behavior between employed and unemployed are large enough. Evidence on spending, shopping, and prices suggests that this is the case.},

  abstract = {I survey the male and female labor supply literatures, focusing on implications for effects of wages and taxes. For males, I describe and contrast results from three basic types of model: static models (especially those that account for nonlinear taxes), life-cycle models with savings, and life-cycle models with both savings and human capital. For women, more important distinctions are whether models include fixed costs of work, and whether they treat demographics like fertility and marriage (and human capital) as exogenous or endogenous. The literature is characterized by considerable controversy over the responsiveness of labor supply to changes in wages and taxes. At least for males, it is fair to say that most economists believe labor supply elasticities are small. But a sizable minority of studies that I examine obtain large values. Hence, there is no clear consensus on this point. In fact, a simple average of Hicks elasticities across all the studies I examine is 0.31. Several simulation studies have shown that such a value is large enough to generate large efficiency costs of income taxation. For males, I conclude that two factors drive many of the differences in results across studies. One factor is use of direct versus ratio wage measures, with studies that use the former tending to find larger elasticities. Another factor is the failure of most studies to account for human capital returns to work experience. I argue that this may lead to downward bias in elasticity estimates. In a model that includes human capital, I show how even modest elasticities---as conventionally measured---can be consistent with large efficiency costs of taxation. For women, in contrast, it is fair to say that most studies find large labor supply elasticities, especially on the participation margin. In particular, I find that estimates of ``long-run'' labor supply elasticities---by which I mean estimates that allow for dynamic effects of wages on fertility, marriage, education and work experience---are generally quite large.

Based on such observation, we propose using neural network to parameterise the physical quantity of interest as a function of input coefficients. The representability of such quantity using a neural network can be justified by viewing the neural network as performing time evolution to find the solutions to the PDE. We further demonstrate the simplicity and accuracy of the approach through notable examples of PDEs in engineering and physics.},

Our quantitative analysis shows that reducing the tax burden on capital formation stimulates investment, but the effects vary depending on whether we target entrepreneurial capital or non-entrepreneurial capital. A low tax on capital income from savings increases the aggregate capital stock and production, but it also raises the opportunity cost of business investment. General equilibrium effects further discourage entrepreneurial investment due to a higher wage cost and a compensating tax increase on other sources of income. The reform is most effective when we reduce the tax on business income. A flat business tax of 10\% will raise entrepreneurial investment by 20\% in the long run. Workers also benefit as the wage increases by 5\%. However, the adjustment costs associated with the transition make political support for such reforms difficult.},

We derive sufficient-statistics formulae capturing the marginal insurance value and incentive costs of unemployment benefits paid at different times during a spell. Our approach allows us to revisit separate arguments for inclining or declining profiles put forward in the theoretical literature and to identify welfare-improving changes in the benefit profile that account for all relevant arguments jointly. For the empirical implementation, we use administrative data on unemployment, linked to data on consumption, income, and wealth in Sweden. First, we exploit duration-dependent kinks in the replacement rate and find that, if anything, the moral hazard cost of benefits is larger when paid earlier in the spell. Second, we find that the drop in consumption affecting the insurance value of benefits is large from the start of the spell, but further increases throughout the spell. In trading off insurance and incentives, our analysis suggests that the flat benefit profile in Sweden has been too generous overall. However, both from the insurance and the incentives side, we find no evidence to support the introduction of a declining tilt in the profile. (JEL D82, E21, E24, J64, J65)},

We focus on the U.S. Great Recession of 2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First, using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document the patterns of household income, consumption and wealth inequality before and during the Great Recession. We then investigate how households in different segments of the wealth distribution were affected by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence we study several variants of a standard heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key model finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate shock, but it does so if (and only if) the distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of households with very little net worth, as is empirically observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance, play for shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business cycles.},

We use the model to evaluate a tax-financed unemployment insurance scheme. Higher insurance is beneficial for consumption smoothing, but because it raises workers' outside option value, it discourages firm entry. We find that the latter effect is more potent for welfare outcomes; we tabulate the effects quantitatively for different kinds of consumers. We also demonstrate that productivity changes in the model---in steady state as well as stochastic ones---generate rather limited unemployment effects, unless workers are close to indifferent between working and not working; thus, recent findings are corroborated in our more general setting.},

The first approach considers the difference in marginal propensity to consume (MPC) when unemployed versus employed, which allows to identify the difference in prices to smooth consumption in the respective states. The second approach exploits UI choices embedded in the Swedish UI system in a Revealed Preference approach. While the drop in consumption expenditures is relatively small (\${\textbackslash}sim\$13\%), we find that the MPC is around 25\% higher when unemployed than employed, translating into a marginal value of transfers that is at least \$60\$\% higher when unemployed than employed. This high value of UI is confirmed by our RP estimates and indicates substantial risk aversion given the relatively small drop in consumption expenditures.},

The model can jointly explain a wide range of intergenerational relationships, such as the intergenerational elasticities (IGE) of lifetime earnings, college attainment and wealth, while remaining empirically consistent with cross-sectional inequality. Much of life-cycle inequality is determined early in life, which in turn is explained in large part by parental background. The model implies that this is mainly due to early investments in children made by young parents, so life-cycle constraints these parents face are important for understanding the persistence of economic status across generations. Education subsidies, especially early on, can significantly reduce the intergenerational persistence of economic status.},

In this paper, we develop a theory-based empirical method to determine which of the observable worker and job characteristics impact the worker-job surplus in the data. To do so, we exploit the mobility choices of employed workers. Our method further indicates whether workers sort along those surplus-relevant attributes when searching for jobs. It also provides a test of the commonly used single-index assumption, according to which worker and job heterogeneity can each be summarized by scalar indices. We implement our method on US data using the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the O*NET. The results suggest that a relatively sparse model underlies the data. On the job side, a cognitive and an interpersonal skill requirement impact the surplus along with the (dis)amenity of work duration as well as the workplace size. On the worker side, we find that most of the relevant characteristics are symmetric to the selected job requirements. We reject the existence of a single-index representation of these relevant multi-dimensional worker and job attributes. We then use our results in a new approach to defining the economy's labor submarkets, highlighting a potentially important application of our methodology.},

To illustrate this point, we use a collective model of household behaviour to estimate consumption inequality in the U.K. from 1968 to 2001. First, the use of adult equivalence scales underestimates the initial level of cross-sectional consumption inequality by 50\%, as large differences in the earnings of husbands and wives translate into large differences in consumption allocations within households. Second, we estimate the rise in between-household inequality has been accompanied by an offsetting reduction in within-household inequality. Our findings also indicate that increases in marital sorting on wages and hours worked can simultaneously explain two-thirds of the decline in within-household inequality and between a quarter and one-half of the rise in between-household inequality for one and two adult households.},

  abstract = {In this article, I develop and estimate a model of on-the-job search in which risk averse workers choose search effort and can borrow or save using a single risk free asset. I derive the implications for optimal savings behaviour in this environment and relate this to the frictions that characterize the endogenous earnings process implied by on-the-job search. Savings behaviour depends in a very intuitive way on the rate at which offers are received, the rate at which jobs are destroyed, and a worker's current rank in the wage distribution. The implication is that workers, who are identical in terms of preferences and opportunities, have substantially different savings behaviour depending on their history and current position in the wage distribution. The mechanism that generates the substantial differences in savings behaviour in the model is the dynamic of the ``wage ladder'' resulting from the search process. There is an important asymmetry between the incremental wage increases generated by on-the-job search (climbing the ladder) and the drop in income associated with job loss (falling off the ladder). The behaviour of workers in low paying jobs is primarily governed by the expectation of wage growth, while the behaviour of workers near the top of the distribution is driven by the possibility of job loss. The distributions of earnings, wealth, and consumption implied by the model (suitably aggregated) align reasonably well with the data, with the notable exception of implying substantially less concentration of wealth among the richest one percent of the population.},

If the shocks that give rise to firm growth are perfectly correlated within a firm, then the growth rates of small and large firms are equally volatile, contrary to what is found in the data. If firm growth is the result of many independent shocks within a firm, it can take hundreds of years for a few large firms to emerge. This paper describes an economy with both types of shocks that can account for the thick-tailed firm size distribution, high entry and exit rates, and the relatively young age of large firms. The economy is one in which aggregate growth is driven by the creation of new products by both new and incumbent firms. Some new firms have better ideas than others and choose to implement those ideas at a more rapid pace. Eventually, such firms slow down when the quality of their ideas reverts to the mean. As in the data, average growth rates in a cross section of firms will appear to be independent of firm size, for all but the smallest firms.},

The positive local impacts of migration depend crucially on the endogenous firm entry. The positive impacts in the destination cities also spill over to the neighboring cities through inter-city trade, often leading to higher welfare gains in the nearby cities than the destination cities themselves. We also show that further relaxing the Hukou restrictions in the largest Chinese cities is welfare-improving to the local residents.},

The model shows how the exposure to trade will induce only the more productive firms to enter the export market (while some less productive firms continue to produce only for the domestic market) and will simultaneously force the least productive firms to exit. It then shows how further increases in the industry's exposure to trade lead to additional inter-firm reallocations towards more productive firms. The paper also shows how the aggregate industry productivity growth generated by the reallocations contributes to a welfare gain, thus highlighting a benefit from trade that has not been examined theoretically before. The paper adapts Hopenhayn's (1992a) dynamic industry model to monopolistic competition in a general equilibrium setting. In so doing, the paper provides an extension of Krugman's (1980) trade model that incorporates firm level productivity differences. Firms with different productivity levels coexist in an industry because each firm faces initial uncertainty concerning its productivity before making an irreversible investment to enter the industry. Entry into the export market is also costly, but the firm's decision to export occurs after it gains knowledge of its productivity.},

Embedding this insight in a two-agent perpetual-youth model, we find that recent trends in income inequality and financial deregulation lead to indebted household demand, pushing down the natural rate of interest. Moreover, popular expansionary policies---such as accommodative monetary policy---generate a debt-financed short-run boom at the expense of indebted demand in the future. When demand is sufficiently indebted, the economy gets stuck in a debt-driven liquidity trap, or debt trap. Escaping a debt trap requires consideration of less conventional macroeconomic policies, such as those focused on redistribution or those reducing the structural sources of high inequality.},

The fraction of workers with short tenure (less than one year) has fallen since the mid-1990s, a trend associated with fewer workers cycling among briefly held jobs and an increase in perceived job security among short-tenure workers. Meanwhile, the fraction of men with long tenure (20 years or more) has declined markedly, partly due to the secular shift away from the manufacturing sector and the decline in unionization, as well as an increase in mid-career separations during the 1970s and 1980s that reduced the likelihood of reaching long tenure.},

To make this argument, we develop a tractable theory that links technology to the distribution of income and wealth---and not just that of wages---and use it to study the distributional effects of automation. We isolate a new theoretical mechanism: automation increases inequality by raising returns to wealth. The flip side of such return movements is that automation can lead to stagnant wages and, therefore, stagnant incomes at the bottom of the distribution. We use a multiasset model extension to confront differing empirical trends in returns to productive and safe assets and show that the relevant return measures have increased over time. Automation can account for part of the observed trends in income and wealth inequality.},

The solutions studied are dynamic stochastic equilibria in the sense that time and uncertainty are explicitly modeled, expectations are rational, private gains from trade are exploited, and the actions taken by all agents are mutually consistent. We argue that the framework provides a useful setting in which to study the effects of alternative wage setting institutions and different labor market policy regimes.}

Firms Bertrand-compete for employed workers according to the Sequential Auctions protocol of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002). Outside job offers to employed workers, when accepted, reallocate employment up the productivity ladder; when declined, because matched by the current employer, they raise production costs and, due to nominal price rigidities, compress mark-ups, building inflationary pressure. When employment is concentrated at the bottom of the job ladder, typically after recessions, the reallocation effect prevails, aggregate supply expands, moderating marginal costs and inflation. As workers climb the job ladder, reducing slack in the employment pool, the inflation effect takes over. The model generates endogenous cyclical movements in the Neo Classical labor wedge and in the New Keynesian wage mark-up. The economy takes time to absorb cyclical misallocation and features propagation in the response of job creation, unemployment and inflation to aggregate shocks. The ratio between jobfinding probabilities job-to-job and from unemployment, a measure of the ``Acceptance rate'' of job offers to employed workers, predicts negatively inflation, independently of the unemployment rate.},

Ex post heterogeneity in productivity across jobs generates a job ladder. Firms Bertrand-compete for employed workers, as in the Sequential Auctions protocol of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002). We identify three channels through which OJS amplifies and propagates aggregate shocks: (i) a higher estimated elasticity of the matching function, when recognizing that at least half of all hires are from other employers; (ii) the differential returns to hiring employed and unemployed job applicants, whose proportions naturally vary over the business cycle; (iii) within employment, the slow reallocation of workers through OJS across rungs of the job ladder, generating endogenous, slowly evolving opportunities for further poaching, which feed back on job creation incentives. Endogenous job destruction, due to either aggregate or idiosyncratic shocks, is countercyclical and thus raises the cyclical volatility of unemployment, closer to its empirical value; but it also stimulates job creation in recessions, to take advantage of the fresh batch of unemployed, and tilts the Beveridge curve up. OJS corrects this tendency and restores a vacancy-unemployment trade-off more in line with empirical observations.},

Leveraging the predictive power of beliefs, we find substantial heterogeneity in job finding with the resulting dynamic selection explaining most of the observed negative duration dependence in job finding. Moreover, job seekers' beliefs underreact to heterogeneity in job finding, distorting search behavior and increasing long-term unemployment.},

What caused the Great Recession? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Identification of causal effects plays two roles in this process. In certain cases, progress can be made using the direct approach of identifying plausibly exogenous variation in a policy and using this variation to assess the effect of the policy. However, external validity concerns limit what can be learned in  this way. Carefully identified causal effects estimates can also be used as moments in a structural moment matching exercise. We use the term "identified moments" as a short-hand for "estimates of responses to identified structural shocks," or what applied microeconomists would call "causal effects." We argue that such identified moments are often powerful  diagnostic tools for distinguishing between important classes of models (and thereby learning about the effects of policy). To illustrate these notions we discuss the growing use of cross-sectional evidence in macroeconomics and consider what the best existing evidence is on the effects of monetary policy.},

In general, the optimal density path is unknown, and solving these variational problems can be computationally challenging. We propose a novel deep learning based framework approaching all of these problems from a unified perspective. Leveraging the dual formulation of the Lagrangians, our method does not require simulating or backpropagating through the trajectories of the learned dynamics, and does not need access to optimal couplings. We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework by outperforming previous approaches for the single-cell trajectory inference, where incorporating prior knowledge into the dynamics is crucial for correct predictions.},

Building on recent machine learning inspired approaches towards high-dimensional PDEs, we investigate the potential of iterative diffusion optimisation techniques, in particular considering applications in importance sampling and rare event simulation, and focusing on problems without diffusion control, with linearly controlled drift and running costs that depend quadratically on the control. More generally, our methods apply to nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a certain shift invariance. The choice of an appropriate loss function being a central element in the algorithmic design, we develop a principled framework based on divergences between path measures, encompassing various existing methods. Motivated by connections to forward-backward SDEs, we propose and study the novel log-variance divergence, showing favourable properties of corresponding Monte Carlo estimators. The promise of the developed approach is exemplified by a range of high-dimensional and metastable numerical examples.},

The aggregate elasticity reflects substitution within plants and reallocation across plants; the extent of heterogeneity in capital intensities determines their relative importance. We use micro data on the cross-section of plants to build up to the aggregate elasticity at a point in time. Interpreting our econometric estimates through the lens of several different models, we find that the aggregate elasticity for the U.S. manufacturing sector is in the range of 0.5--0.7, and has declined slightly since 1970. We use our estimates to measure the bias of technical change and assess the decline in labor's share of income in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Mechanisms that rely on changes in the relative supply of factors, such as an acceleration of capital accumulation, cannot account for the decline.},

When it comes to analyzing exchange rate dynamics, an empirically-minded economist abandons modern current account models which, while theoretically coherent, fail to address the awkward reality of sticky nominal prices. In this paper we develop an analytically tractable two-country model that marries a full account of dynamics to a supply framework based on monopolistic competition and sticky prices. It offers simple and intuitive predictions about exchange rates and current accounts that sometimes differ sharply from those of either modern flexible-price intertemporal models, or traditional sticky-price Keynesian models. The model also leads to a novel perspective on the international welfare spillovers of monetary and fiscal policies.},

This paper shows empirically that the unequal incidence of recessions is a core channel through which aggregate shocks are amplified. I show that the aggregate marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is larger when income shocks disproportionately hit high-MPC individuals, and I define the matching multiplier as the component of the output multiplier that comes from this heterogeneous incidence. Using administrative data from the United States, I document that the earnings of individuals with a higher marginal propensity to consume are more exposed to recessions. I show that this covariance between worker MPCs and the elasticity of their earnings to GDP is large enough to increase shock amplification by 40 percent over a benchmark in which all workers are equally exposed. Using local labor market variation, I validate this amplification mechanism by showing that areas with higher matching multipliers experience larger employment fluctuations over the business cycle. Lastly, I derive a generalization of the matching multiplier in an incomplete markets model and show numerically that this mechanism is quantitatively similar within this structural framework.},

In contrast to demand shocks, supply shocks are amplified through both, cognitive discounting and household heterogeneity, such that inflation increases more than twice as strong as when abstracting from cognitive discounting and household heterogeneity.},

Popular models of firm heterogeneity cannot easily account for the U-shape or for the persistence of low-productivity firms.

Workers and firms face a trade-off between the workerjob fit and the speed of forming a match, and lower asset holdings make workers and firms agree upon a larger range of acceptable matches. We refer to this phenomenon as ``precautionary mismatch'' and show that it leads to substantial earnings and productivity dispersion between wealth-rich and wealth-poor workers of the same production type. We estimate that total output would be 3\% higher in the US if all employed workers were allocated to the right jobs. In a quantitative experiment, we find that wealth transfers from incumbent workers to young labor market entrants reduce within-type earnings inequality and enhance labor productivity. Most of the productivity gains come from reduced under-matches of high-productivity workers.},

Weak rule-of-law institutions substantially amplify the negative impact of financial frictions.

The study hypothesizes that the type of transfer received by the child influences the nature of support they provide in later life. Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), the findings suggest a positive correlation between educational transfers and financial support provided by the child, while transfers towards supporting a child's marriage are positively linked to increased time support in terms of visits to the elder parents. The results also provide tentative evidence that children's place of residence may act as a mediating factor, with educational transfers leading to greater geographical distance, while marital transfers are associated with children staying closer to their parents.},

In particular, we show that policies which create heterogeneity in the prices faced by individual producers can lead to sizeable decreases in output and measured total factor productivity (TFP) in the range of 30 to 50 percent. We show that these effects can result from policies that do not rely on aggregate capital accumulation or aggregate relative price differences.

Suitable weights can help reconcile discrepancies between the welfarist approach and actual tax practice, as well as unify in an operational way the most prominent alternatives to utilitarianism such as Libertarianism, equality of opportunity, or poverty alleviation.

We examine this difference and, using public data, quantify three main issues in Smith et al. (2022). First, Securities and Exchange Commission data at the shareholder firm level show that billionaires' equity wealth is underestimated by a factor of 2.1. Second, interest-bearing assets at the top are under-estimated by a factor of 1.6, because of an extrapolation from a small and unrepresentative sample of investment funds. We quantify this issue using mandatory filings of US hedge funds. Third, issues involving tiered partnerships and the measurement of business profits suggest that large S-corporations are undervalued by a factor of 1.2 and top-owned partnerships by up to 2.2. After incorporating these results, the top 0.01\% wealth share of Smith et al. (2022) is close to the one found in Saez and Zucman (2020) and estimates of US wealth inequality are reconciled.},

This pattern is robust across demographic characteristics and data sources. To understand these trends, I build a generalequilibrium heterogeneous-agent model with occupational choices and two types of selfemployment. To investigate the source of the aggregate trends in entrepreneurship, I conduct counterfactual experiments. I evaluate two potential factors observed in the data over the same period: (i) an investment-specific technological change and (ii) a decline in tax progressivity. The results show that the main driver of declining entrepreneurship is technological change, whereas the decline in tax progressivity played a minor role.},

I show that the model can replicate salient features of the microeconomic behavior of firms and that the introduction of volatility improves the fit of the model for standard business cycle moments. In a series of counterfactual experiments, I show that time-varying risk is important to account for the magnitude of fluctuations in aggregate unemployment for past U.S. recessions. Though the model can account for about 40\% of the total increase in unemployment for the 2007--2009 recession, uncertainty alone is not sufficient to explain the magnitude and persistence of unemployment during that episode.},

My empirical analysis shows that younger cohorts have steeper growth in the skill premium before age 40 but flatter growth after 40. I use a human capital investment model to account for the cross-cohort variation in skill premium profiles. The results indicate that the flattened growth after age 40 is caused by the drop in human capital (of high-skill workers) near the end of the life cycle. Besides, the magnitude of life-cycle growth in the skill premium is mainly driven by the relative skill price, which is the log ratio of wage rates between high-skill workers and low-skill workers.},

The observation that the wedge is higher in continental Europe than in the United States has proved useful for understanding the extent to which taxes can explain differences in labor market outcomes. The observation that the ratio rises during recessions suggests some failure of competitive, market-clearing macroeconomic models at business cycle frequencies. The latter observation has guided recent research, including work on sticky wage models and job search models. (JEL E24, E32, J64)},

We also show that the social optimum can be implemented by a realistic market equilibrium where the organizers set up trading sites to direct the other side's search. The results provide a unified explanation for why trade has often been organized by sellers in the goods market, by buyers (firms) in the labor market, and by both sides in the asset market. The analysis also sheds light on how the efficient market organization can change with innovations such as e-commerce and just-in-time production.},

I study the implications of this fact for the distributional consequences of climate change, using a dynamic, stochastic, heterogeneous-agent model with 1713 locations. Forward-looking equilibrium real estate prices and rents endogenously respond to climate news shocks in spatially-segmented markets. Households participate on both sides of each market. To quantify climate impacts on economic fundamentals, I harmonize recent estimates of local productivity, amenities, energy costs, and disaster damage sensitivities. I find the model's global solution under aggregate climate uncertainty with a simple but general deep learning method introduced in a companion paper. In the calibrated model, a switch from widespread climate denial to widespread climate acceptance causes an effective transfer of housing wealth across regions of \$41bn immediately and \$507bn over the following century. Migration exacerbates this by amplifying housing price responses. The spatially-equalizing effects of migration only dominate for all households 50 years post-shock. Climate uncertainty causes ongoing regressive wealth transfers through higher equilibrium rents, borne mostly by poorer households.},

We estimate the model and use it to assess the relative contribution of the different factors for overall wage inequality. We find that variation in premarket skills (the key feature of the Roy model) is the most important component to account for the majority of wage variation. We also demonstrate that there is substantial interaction between the other components, most notably, that the importance of the job match obtained by search frictions varies from around 4\% to around 29\%, depending on how we account for other components. Inequality due to preferences for non-pecuniary aspects of the job (which leads to compensating differentials) and search are both very important for explaining other features of the data. Search is important for turnover, but so are preferences for non-pecuniary aspects of jobs as one-third of all choices between two jobs would have resulted in a different outcome if the worker only cared about wages.},

Our simple model also sheds light on a number of other important issues, such as the ``Great Moderation'' and the simultaneously rising trends of dispersions in sales growth and stock returns for publicly traded firms.},

However, despite their remarkable early promise, they typically require large training data-sets consisting of paired input-output observations which may be expensive to obtain, while their predictions may not be consistent with the underlying physical principles that generated the observed data. In this work, we propose a novel model class coined as physics-informed DeepONets, which introduces an effective regularization mechanism for biasing the outputs of DeepOnet models towards ensuring physical consistency. This is accomplished by leveraging automatic differentiation to impose the underlying physical laws via soft penalty constraints during model training. We demonstrate that this simple, yet remarkably effective extension can not only yield a significant improvement in the predictive accuracy of DeepOnets, but also greatly reduce the need for large training data-sets. To this end, a remarkable observation is that physics-informed DeepONets are capable of solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) without any paired input-output observations, except for a set of given initial or boundary conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a series of comprehensive numerical studies across various types of PDEs. Strikingly, a trained physics informed DeepOnet model can predict the solution of O(103) timedependent PDEs in a fraction of a second -- up to three orders of magnitude faster compared a conventional PDE solver.

The endogenous liquid wealth-illiquid capital ratio w measures time-varying financial constraint. The option to accumulate wealth before entry is critical for entrepreneurship. Flexible exit option is important for risk management purposes. Investment increases and the private marginal value of liquidity decreases as w decreases and exit becomes more likely, contrary to predictions of standard financial constraint models. We show that the idiosyncratic risk premium is quantitatively significant, especially for low w.},

To assess these effects in a tractable general-equilibrium framework, we introduce endogenous search frictions, in the spirit of Peter Diamond (1990), in both credit and labor markets. We demonstrate that credit frictions amplify macroeconomic volatility through a financial accelerator. The magnitude of this general-equilibrium accelerator is proportional to the credit gap, defined as the deviation of actual output from its perfect credit market level. We explore various extensions, notably endogenous wages.},

This paper introduces frictions into a standard two-country neoclassical growth model to explain the pattern of two-way capital {\ddag}ows between emerging economies (such as China) and the developed world (such as the United States). We show how underdeveloped {\dots}nancial markets in China can lead to abnormally high rates of return to {\dots}xed capital but excessively low rates of return to {\dots}nancial capital relative to the U.S., hence driving out household savings ({\dots}nancial capital) on the one hand while simultaneously attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) on the other. When calibrated to match China's high marginal product of capital and low real interest rate, our model is able to account for China's rising {\dots}nancial capital out{\ddag}ows and FDI in{\ddag}ows as well as its massive trade imbalances in the past decades. Our model yields two additional implications that stand in sharp contrast to the existing literature: (i) Global trade imbalances between emerging economies and the developed world may be sustainable even in the long run; and (ii) the conventional wisdom that the "saving glut" of emerging economies is responsible for the global low world interest rate may be wrong.},

Using international stock market returns as a shift-share instrument supports a causal interpretation of parental wealth on offspring's housing outcomes. We further document that housing outcomes when young are important determinants of midlife wealth, using plausibly exogenous variation caused by the timing of intra-family deaths. Housing gaps caused purely by parental wealth explain more than 10\% of intergenerational wealth persistence. With regard to mechanisms, we find that parents use transfers, home equity withdrawals, co-purchasing and intra-family house sales at discounted prices to support their offspring. Through the lens of our model, house price expectations stand out as a key driver of the housing channel of intergenerational wealth persistence.},

Using micro-data from China, we document that individuals' liquidity constraint is easing over time, driven by both aggregate productivity growth and financial development. We develop a quantitative macroeconomic model of entrepreneurship with endogenous financial development to analyze the impact of aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) growth and financial innovation shocks on macroeconomic outcomes. We find that financial innovation accounts for half of the aggregate productivity growth between 1990 and 2010 in China. Furthermore, aggregate TFP growth explains around 10\% of the expansion of the banking sector. In addition, endogenous financial development contributes to about 30\% of the overall loosening of the liquidity constraint. Both aggregate TFP and financial innovation shocks have substantial effects on the macro-economy. Finally, we demonstrate that policies aimed at promoting entrepreneurship become less effective over time following financial development.},

  abstract = {The estate tax has been considered by its supporters as a natural way to reduce wealth inequality because it targets the affluent directly. This paper documents that the relative importance of inheritance is less significant for wealthy heirs, as they inherit less relative to their wealth. Notably, over half of the richest one percent report receiving no inheritance at all. Then, in a quantitative model that accounts for these novel facts on inheritance received by the rich, this paper finds that the impact of estate taxation on wealth redistribution and overall welfare is small. Even with a hypothetical 100\% estate tax rate, the wealth share of the top one percent would only decrease by 3.5 percentage points. The estate tax rate that maximizes welfare achieves a gain of only 0.24\%, as measured by the consumption equivalent variation. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that estate taxation, compared to other major tax reforms, such as the top income taxation, incurs a greater loss in aggregate output for an equivalent amount of wealth redistribution, suggesting that despite its direct targeting of the affluent, estate taxation may not be an effective tool for wealth redistribution.},

We characterize the principal's dynamic value function, which could be discontinuous at the boundary, as the (unique) minimal solution of an infinite dimensional system of HJB equations, parametrized by the agent's type. This dynamic problem is time consistent in certain sense. Some interesting findings are worth mentioning. First, self-enforcing contracts are typically suboptimal. The principal would rather let the agent quit and hire a new one. Next, the standard contract for a committed agent may also be suboptimal, due to the presence of different types of agents in our model. The principal may prefer no commitment from the agent, then she can hire a cheaper one from the market at a later time by designing the contract to induce the current agent to quit. Moreover, due to the cost incurring to the agent, the principal will see only finitely many quittings.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel solution framework for the class of dynamic macroeconomic models with a continuum of heterogeneous agents and aggregate uncertainty. In these models, an agent's state variables include her individual state vector and a distribution function representing all agents' states, an infinite-dimensional object. Unlike the prevalent benchmark method that approximates the distribution function with a high-dimensional vector of simulated agents, this paper suggests the formulation of the policy function as an operator that maps between function spaces. The operator is parameterized by a cutting-edge neural network architecture known as the neural operator. This proposed framework offers significant computational advantages due to its three defining properties: discretization-invariance, permutation-invariance, and aggregation-sharing. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by solving the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model with aggregate uncertainty, a benchmark in computational economics literature. The proposed framework not only demonstrates computational efficiency as it manages tens of thousands of agents during simulations to precisely approximate the distribution function but also showcases its superior performance, achieving solutions with less than a one percent relative error in a shorter computational time compared to the benchmark method.},
